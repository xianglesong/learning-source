/**
 * The result of an asynchronous {@link Channel} I/O operation.
 * <p>
 * All I/O operations in Netty are asynchronous. It means any I/O calls will return immediately with
 * no guarantee that the requested I/O operation has been completed at the end of the call. Instead,
 * you will be returned with a {@link ChannelFuture} instance which tells you when the requested I/O
 * operation has succeeded, failed, or cancelled.
 * <p>
 * Various methods are provided to let you check if the I/O operation has been completed, wait for
 * the completion, and retrieve the result of the I/O operation. It also allows you to add more than
 * one {@link ChannelFutureListener} so you can get notified when the I/O operation has been
 * completed.
 *
 * <h3>Prefer {@link #addListener(ChannelFutureListener)} to {@link #await()}</h3>
 *
 * It is recommended to prefer {@link #addListener(ChannelFutureListener)} to {@link #await()}
 * wherever possible to get notified when an I/O operation is done and to do any follow-up tasks.
 * <p>
 * {@link #addListener(ChannelFutureListener)} is non-blocking. It simply adds the specified
 * {@link ChannelFutureListener} to the {@link ChannelFuture}, and I/O thread will notify the
 * listeners when the I/O operation associated with the future is done.
 * {@link ChannelFutureListener} yields the best performance and resource utilization because it
 * does not block at all, but it could be tricky to implement a sequential logic if you are not used
 * to event-driven programming.
 * <p>
 * By contrast, {@link #await()} is a blocking operation. Once called, the caller thread blocks
 * until the operation is done. It is easier to implement a sequential logic with {@link #await()},
 * but the caller thread blocks unnecessarily until the I/O operation is done and there's relatively
 * expensive cost of inter-thread notification. Moreover, there's a chance of dead lock in a
 * particular circumstance, which is described below.
 *
 * <h3>Do not call {@link #await()} inside {@link ChannelHandler}</h3>
 * <p>
 * The event handler methods in {@link ChannelHandler} is often called by an I/O thread unless an
 * {@link ExecutionHandler} is in the {@link ChannelPipeline}. If {@link #await()} is called by an
 * event handler method, which is called by the I/O thread, the I/O operation it is waiting for
 * might never be complete because {@link #await()} can block the I/O operation it is waiting for,
 * which is a dead lock.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * // BAD - NEVER DO THIS
 * public void messageReceived(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, MessageEvent e) {
 *   if (e.getMessage() instanceof GoodByeMessage) {
 *     ChannelFuture future = e.getChannel().close();
 *     future.awaitUninterruptibly();
 *     // Perform post-closure operation
 *     // ...
 *   }
 * }
 * 
 * // GOOD
 * public void messageReceived(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, MessageEvent e) {
 *   if (e.getMessage() instanceof GoodByeMessage) {
 *     ChannelFuture future = e.getChannel().close();
 *     future.addListener(new ChannelFutureListener() {
 *       public void operationComplete(ChannelFuture future) {
 *         // Perform post-closure operation
 *         // ...
 *       }
 *     });
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * In spite of the disadvantages mentioned above, there are certainly the cases where it is more
 * convenient to call {@link #await()}. In such a case, please make sure you do not call
 * {@link #await()} in an I/O thread. Otherwise, {@link IllegalStateException} will be raised to
 * prevent a dead lock.
