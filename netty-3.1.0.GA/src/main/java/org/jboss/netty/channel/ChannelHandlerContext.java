package org.jboss.netty.channel;

/**
 * Provides the properties and operations which are specific to a
 * {@link ChannelHandler} and the {@link ChannelPipeline} it belongs to.
 * Via a {@link ChannelHandlerContext}, a {@link ChannelHandler} can send
 * an upstream or downstream {@link ChannelEvent} to the next or previous
 * {@link ChannelHandler} in a pipeline, modify the behavior of the pipeline,
 * or store the information (attachment) which is specific to the handler.
 * <pre>
 *         <b>n</b> = the number of the handler entries in a pipeline
 *
 * +---------+ 1 .. 1 +----------+ 1    n +---------+ n    m +---------+
 * | Channel |--------| Pipeline |--------| Context |--------| Handler |
 * +---------+        +----------+        +----+----+        +----+----+
 *                                             | 1..1             |
 *                                       +-----+------+           |
 *                                       | Attachment |<----------+
 *                                       +------------+    stores
 * </pre>
 * Please note that a {@link ChannelHandler} instance can be added to more than
 * one {@link ChannelPipeline}.  It means a single {@link ChannelHandler}
 * instance can have more than one {@link ChannelHandlerContext} and therefore
 * the single instance can be invoked with different
 * {@link ChannelHandlerContext}s if it is added to one or more
 * {@link ChannelPipeline}s more than once.
 * <p>
 * For example, the following handler will have as many independent attachments
 * as how many times it is added to pipelines, regardless if it is added to the
 * same pipeline multiple times or added to different pipelines multiple times:
 * <pre>
 * public class FactorialHandler extends SimpleUpstreamChannelHandler {
 *
 *   // This handler will receive a sequence of increasing integers starting
 *   // from 1.
 *   public void messageReceived(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, MessageEvent evt) {
 *     Integer a = (Integer) ctx.getAttachment();
 *     Integer b = (Integer) evt.getMessage();
 *
 *     if (a == null) {
 *       a = 1;
 *     }
 *
 *     ctx.setAttachment(Integer.valueOf(a * b));
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * // Different context objects are given to "f1", "f2", "f3", and "f4" even if
 * // they refer to the same handler instance.  Because the FactorialHandler
 * // stores its state in a context object (as an attachment), the factorial is
 * // calculated correctly 4 times once the two pipelines (p1 and p2) are active.
 * FactorialHandler fh = new FactorialHandler();
 *
 * ChannelPipeline p1 = Channels.pipeline();
 * p1.addLast("f1", fh);
 * p1.addLast("f2", fh);
 *
 * ChannelPipeline p2 = Channels.pipeline();
 * p2.addLast("f3", fh);
 * p2.addLast("f4", fh);
 * </pre>
 *

 * <p>
 * Please refer to the {@link ChannelHandler}, {@link ChannelEvent}, and
 * {@link ChannelPipeline} to find out what a upstream event and a downstream
 * event are, what fundamental differences they have, and how they flow in a
 * pipeline.
