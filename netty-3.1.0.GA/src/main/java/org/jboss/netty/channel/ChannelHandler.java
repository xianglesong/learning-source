/**
 * Handles or intercepts a {@link ChannelEvent}, and sends a {@link ChannelEvent} to the next or
 * previous handler in a {@link ChannelPipeline}.
 *
 * <h3>Sub-types</h3>
 * <p>
 * {@link ChannelHandler} itself does not provide any method. To handle a {@link ChannelEvent} you
 * need to implement its sub-interfaces. There are two sub-interfaces which handles a received
 * event, one for upstream events and the other for downstream events:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link ChannelUpstreamHandler} handles and intercepts an upstream {@link ChannelEvent}.</li>
 * <li>{@link ChannelDownstreamHandler} handles and intercepts a downstream {@link ChannelEvent}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * You will also find more detailed explanation from the documentation of each sub-interface on how
 * an event is interpreted when it goes upstream and downstream respectively.
 *
 * <h3>The context object</h3>
 * <p>
 * A {@link ChannelHandler} is provided with a {@link ChannelHandlerContext} object. A
 * {@link ChannelHandler} is supposed to interact with the {@link ChannelPipeline} it belongs to via
 * a context object. Using the context object, the {@link ChannelHandler} can pass events to the
 * next or the previous handler or modify the behavior of the pipeline, or store the information
 * (attachment) which is specific to the handler.
 *
 * <h3>Additional resources worth reading</h3>
 * <p>
 * Please refer to the {@link ChannelEvent} and {@link ChannelPipeline} to find out what a upstream
 * event and a downstream event are, what fundamental differences they have, and how they flow in a
 * pipeline.
